# BMI-calculator
A simple calculator that calculates BMI

code:
Weight = input('Whats your weight in kilos?: ')
Height = input('Whats your height in meters?: ')
BMI = float(Weight) / float(Height) / float(Height)
print('Your BMI is: ')
print(BMI)
print('Made by Uros Velicki 2019')
Bye = input('Press Enter to exit...')

Once you open the thing in python you'll be prompted with you to enter your weight and then height
height like so, x.xx
the cmd will write out 'Your BMI is: '
and then it will print the BMI
